    Link to heading
  

Horizon TV is Liberty Global&rsquo;s flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to televisions, in 2012. H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber&rsquo;s house.[69] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo&rsquo;s CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[70]
Twitter was integrated into Horizon&rsquo;s mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast. Horizon TV was also launched in Austria in 2016, making it available in all three German-speaking countries where Liberty Global operates.
In September 2018, Liberty Global announced the next-generation video platform Horizon 4.">
